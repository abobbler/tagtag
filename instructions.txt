# Running
Note that this script doesn't ask for many things, such as the region where
services are hosted.

You can use this script as:
python3 bucket.py your-bucket-name
python3 bucket.py your-bucket-name:/path/to/data/
python3 bucket.py your-bucket-name:/path/to/files/*.py

## Authentication
Authentication will be handled by the AWS SDK. You can configure your system
with `aws configure`, you may specify the config file with the environment
variable `AWS_CONFIG_FILE`, `AWS_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE`, etc. You might
specify a testing instance name with `AWS_PROFILE` that corresponds to an
entry within the credentials file.
